This section will walk you through how to install a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using EKS.

link:https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes, window="_blank"] (Amazon EKS) makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS.

Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructure for you across multiple AWS availability zones to eliminate a single point of failure. Amazon EKS is certified Kubernetes conformant so you can use existing tooling and plugins from partners and the Kubernetes community. Applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment are fully compatible and can be easily migrated to Amazon EKS.

If you have not set up the link:../101-start-here[Cloud9 Development Environment, window="_blank"] yet, please do so before continuing.

== Create a Kubernetes Cluster with EKS

EKS can be used to create a highly available cluster, with multiple master nodes spread across multiple availability zones.

=== Create the master nodes

Create a Kubernetes cluster using the following command. Run it in the "bash" terminal tab at the bottom of the Cloud9 IDE. This will create a cluster with master nodes:

    $ aws eks create-cluster \
      --name k8s-workshop \
      --role-arn $EKS_SERVICE_ROLE \
      --resources-vpc-config subnetIds=${EKS_SUBNET_IDS},securityGroupIds=${EKS_SECURITY_GROUPS} \
      --kubernetes-version 1.10

The `EKS_SERVICE_ROLE`, `EKS_SUBNET_IDS`, and `EKS_SECURITY_GROUPS` environment variables should have been set during the link:../101-start-here[Cloud9 Environment Setup].

Cluster provisioning usually takes less than 10 minutes. You can query the status of your cluster with the following command. When your cluster status is `ACTIVE`, you can proceed.

    $ aws eks describe-cluster --name k8s-workshop --query cluster.status --output text

Note: If your 'create cluster' fails with an error like:
```
aws: error: argument --role-arn: expected one argument
```
Please confirm the following environment variables are set before executing the 'create cluster' command:
```
echo $EKS_SERVICE_ROLE
echo $EKS_SUBNET_IDS
echo $EKS_SECURITY_GROUPS
```
If any of those environment variables are blank, please re-run the "Build Script" section of the link:../101-start-here[Cloud9 Environment Setup].

=== Create the configuration file

In order to access the cluster locally, use a configuration file (sometimes referred to as a `kubeconfig` file). This configuration file can be created automatically.

Once the cluster has moved to the `ACTIVE` state, download and run the `create-kubeconfig.sh` script.

    aws s3 cp s3://aws-kubernetes-artifacts/v0.5/create-kubeconfig.sh . && \
    chmod +x create-kubeconfig.sh && \
    . ./create-kubeconfig.sh

This will create a configuration file at `$HOME/.kube/config` and update the necessary environment variable for default access.

=== Create the worker nodes

Now that your EKS master nodes are created, you can launch and configure your worker nodes.

To launch your worker nodes, run the following CloudFormation CLI command:

    $ aws cloudformation create-stack \
      --stack-name k8s-workshop-worker-nodes \
      --template-url https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.10.3/2018-06-05/amazon-eks-nodegroup.yaml \
      --capabilities "CAPABILITY_IAM" \
      --parameters "[{\"ParameterKey\": \"KeyName\", \"ParameterValue\": \"${AWS_STACK_NAME}\"},
                     {\"ParameterKey\": \"NodeImageId\", \"ParameterValue\": \"${EKS_WORKER_AMI}\"},
                     {\"ParameterKey\": \"ClusterName\", \"ParameterValue\": \"k8s-workshop\"},
                     {\"ParameterKey\": \"NodeGroupName\", \"ParameterValue\": \"k8s-workshop-nodegroup\"},
                     {\"ParameterKey\": \"ClusterControlPlaneSecurityGroup\", \"ParameterValue\": \"${EKS_SECURITY_GROUPS}\"},
                     {\"ParameterKey\": \"VpcId\", \"ParameterValue\": \"${EKS_VPC_ID}\"},
                     {\"ParameterKey\": \"Subnets\", \"ParameterValue\": \"${EKS_SUBNET_IDS}\"}]"

The `AWS_MASTER_STACK`, `EKS_WORKER_AMI`, `EKS_VPC_ID`, `EKS_SUBNET_IDS`, and `EKS_SECURITY_GROUPS` environment variables should have been set during the link:../101-start-here[Cloud9 Environment Setup].

Node provisioning usually takes less than 5 minutes. You can query the status of your cluster with the following command. When your cluster status is `CREATE_COMPLETE`, you can proceed.

    $ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name k8s-workshop-worker-nodes --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text

=== Enable worker nodes to join cluster

To enable worker nodes to join your cluster, download and run the `aws-auth-cm.sh` script.

    aws s3 cp s3://aws-kubernetes-artifacts/v0.5/aws-auth-cm.sh . && \
    chmod +x aws-auth-cm.sh && \
    . ./aws-auth-cm.sh

Watch the status of your nodes and wait for them to reach the `Ready` status.

    $ kubectl get nodes --watch

== Kubernetes Cluster Context

You can manage multiple Kubernetes clusters with _kubectl_, the Kubernetes CLI. We will look more deeply at kubectl in the next section. The configuration for each cluster is stored in a configuration file, referred to as the "`kubeconfig file`". By default, kubectl looks for a file named `config` in the directory `~/.kube`. The kubectl CLI uses kubeconfig file to find the information it needs to choose a cluster and communicate with the API server of a cluster.

This allows you to deploy your applications to different environments by just changing the context. For example, here is a typical flow for application development:

. Build your application using a development environment (perhaps even locally on your laptop)
. Change the context to a test cluster created on AWS
. Use the same command to deploy to the test environment
. Once satisfied, change the context again to a production cluster on AWS
. Once again, use the same command to deploy to production environment

Get a summary of available contexts:

  $ kubectl config get-contexts
  CURRENT   NAME      CLUSTER      AUTHINFO   NAMESPACE
  *         aws       kubernetes   aws

The output shows different contexts, one per cluster, that are available to kubectl. `NAME` column shows the context name. `*` indicates the current context.

View the current context:

  $ kubectl config current-context
  aws

If multiple clusters exist, then you can change the context:

  $ kubectl config use-context <config-name>

You are now ready to continue on with the workshop!

== Alternative: Create a Kubernetes Cluster with kops

This section will walk you through how to install a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using kops.

https://github.com/kubernetes/kops[kops, window="_blank"], short for Kubernetes Operations, is a set of tools for installing, operating, and deleting Kubernetes clusters. kops can also perform rolling upgrades from older versions of Kubernetes to newer ones, and manage the cluster add-ons.

kops can be used to create a highly available cluster, with multiple master and worker nodes spread across multiple availability zones.
The master and worker nodes within the cluster can use either DNS or the https://github.com/weaveworks/mesh[Weave Mesh, window="_blank"] *gossip* protocol for name resolution.  For this workshop, we will use the gossip protocol.  A gossip-based cluster is easier and quicker to setup, and does not require a domain, subdomain, or Route53 hosted zone to be registered. Instructions for creating a DNS-based cluster are provided as an appendix at the bottom of this page.

To create a cluster using the gossip protocol, simply use a cluster name with a suffix of `.k8s.local`. In the following steps, we will use `example.cluster.k8s.local` as a sample gossip cluster name. You may choose a different name as long as it ends with `.k8s.local`.

The command below creates a cluster in a multi-master, multi-node, and multi-az configuration.
Run it in the "bash" terminal tab at the bottom of the Cloud9 IDE.
We can create and build the cluster in one step by passing the `--yes` flag.

    $ kops create cluster \
      --name example.cluster.k8s.local \
      --master-count 3 \
      --node-count 5 \
      --zones $AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES \
      --yes

A multi-master cluster can be created by using the `--master-count` option and specifying the number of master nodes. An odd value is recommended. By default, the master nodes are spread across the AZs specified using the `--zones` option. Alternatively, you can use the `--master-zones` option to explicitly specify the zones for the master nodes.

The `--zones` option is also used to distribute the worker nodes. The number of workers is specified using the `--node-count` option.

It will take 5-8 minutes for the cluster to be created. Validate the cluster:

```
$ kops validate cluster
Using cluster from kubectl context: example.cluster.k8s.local

```

Note that all masters are spread across different AZs.

Your output may differ slightly from the one shown here based up on the type of cluster you created.
